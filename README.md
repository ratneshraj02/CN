# Data Communication &amp; Computer Network

### Data Communication : 
It is the process of sending and receiving data among several people through a certain chhannel. It refers to the source &amp; destination of messages &amp; data that transmitted by a predefined path or route that is (physical or logical) in communication the following components are required:

- **Sender**: It is organator or source of message that generates and it can either be a person or a machine.

- **Receiver**: A destination of message where transmission will stop receiver can also a person or a machine.

 - **Transmission Medium**: It is a well defined route through which message are transmitted from sender to receiver. A medium can be physical (like wire, cable) or wireless (like internet). 

 ### Types of Data Communication:
 Data Communication among the devices can be further catetgorized into three categories:

 1. **Simplex**: Simplex communication refers to uni-directional (i.e one-way), which means sender can only sends the data & receiver receives but receiver can't resend data to sender.

 e.g :
   - Radio Broadcasting
   - Television Broadcast
   - Infrared in Remote Control
   - Printer attached to CPU, etc.
 

2. **Half Duplex**: It supports bi-direcational but a time data can be transfered from one end i.e sender sends data or reciever after a time gep reciever and resend the data.

 e.g :
   - Pager
   - Fex
   - Telegram
   - Wirless radio
   - Walkie-Tolkie etc.
 

3. **Full Duplex**: It is complete bi-direcational communication where sender & reciever can exchange their dat at the same time.

 e.g :
   - Telephone
   - Cellular Phone
   - Internet
   - Satellite Phone etc.
 
### Mode of Data Communication

1. **Synchronus Communication :** It is a method where data is sends continuosly from a stream of. In synchornus communication data is sends serialy till the last bit &amp; reciever reciev the bit serialy.

    It is realtime communication between two or more parties at the same time. It involves immediate response &amp; interactive communication.

    It is best situable for collaborating tasks.

     e.g :
   - Telephone calling
   - video conferencing etc.
2. **Asynchronous Communication :**
